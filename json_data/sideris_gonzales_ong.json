While these studies discuss mostly the processes and impacts of gentrification, we are not aware of studies that focus on the methodologies of studying gentrification. In general, a methodological dichotomy characterizes much of the existing gentrification literature, as studies are either quantitative, “macro” analyses or qualitative, “micro” inqui-ries of neighborhoods in the form of case studies (Hammel and Wyly 1996). But there is often a “disconnect” between quantitative and qualitative approaches that are designed to gather and analyze different types of data, and only few gen-trification studies adopt a mixed-methods approach. The presence or absence of gentrification is often hotly debated by residents, who experience impacts such as increased rents or store closures in their neighborhoods, and policy makers and academics, who use aggregate census data to document neighborhood change and may not see these impacts. This article seeks to show the importance of incor - porating knowledge from both quantitative and qualitative methods to study gentrification.

Therefore, we are also interested to understand what each method contributes; under which circumstances plan-ners may be able to identify a “methodological short-cut” in studying gentrification; and which cases require more elabo-rate and multiple methodological approaches. The study examines the contribution of three methods to our understanding of gentrification processes in four Los Angeles transit neighborhoods: (1) measures based on sec-ondary data; (2) systematic street- and parcel-level observa-tions; and (3) interviews with representatives from community-based organizations (CBOs) and public agencies active in the four neighborhoods. The goals are to examine the degree to which gentrification exists in the four neighbor - hoods; compare and contrast the type of data gathered by each method; and understand each method’s potential and limitations in capturing neighborhood change. The study draws from a larger project that examined the impact of transit investment on gentrification around stations in LA County and the Bay Area, finding that the presence of a transit station was a significant independent variable, but whose effects varied across time periods and neighborhoods.

Using four case studies of transit neighborhoods in Los Angeles, this study utilizes a mixed-methods approach to examine a particular aspect of neighborhood change—gentrification.

And indeed we found that, on average, station neighborhoods have experienced more development than nonstation neighborhoods. But they have also witnessed greater increases in white, college-edu-cated, and higher income households and are changing more in the direction of gentrification than neighborhoods without transit stations (Chapple et al. 2017). This systemwide evalu-ation of station impact offered us an opportunity to test a mixed-methods approach and examine the presence and extent of gentrification in some diverse low-income neigh-borhoods. Thus, in the present article, we focus on four sta-tion neighborhoods from the larger study—Chinatown, Hollywood/Western, 103rd St/Watts, and Mariachi Plaza—to highlight what we have learned from the methods employed. In what follows, we present a literature review of the methodologies used to measure neighborhood change and gentrification, discuss the study context and methods, and detail findings gleaned from each method. We conclude by discussing each method’s potential and limitations. Literature Review: Methods for Capturing Neighborhood Change Neighborhood change is driven by at least three dynamic processes: movement of people, public policies and invest-ments, and flows of private capital (Zuk et al. 2015). The nature and intensity of change may vary across neighbor - hoods in a metropolitan area because of spatial variations in these factors. An example is the geographic"

An example is the geographic distribution of infrastructure investment such as the building of a transit station. Neighborhood change may have positive or negative effects for residents. Following suburbanization, deindustri-alization, and white flight after World War II, many inner-city neighborhoods in the United States witnessed negative change—sharp disinvestment and decline. Early studies of neighborhood change focused on such decline or “descent,” as well as disinvestment, demographic shifts, and discrimi-natory practices (Massey and Denton 1993). More recently, following investments to regenerate inner cities, some stud-ies have focused on the consequences of the upward trajec-tories of neighborhoods, or neighborhood “ascent” (Zuk et al. 2015). Gentrification is a commonly studied outcome of neigh- borhood ascent (Zuk et al. 2015). The influx of higher-income new residents may lead to displacement of existing residents. Finding data that allow for the simultaneous measurement of physical, cultural, economic, and demo-graphic shifts ensuing from gentrification, however, can be an arduous task (Benton 2014). Thus, much research has only measured the magnitude of particular aspects or impacts of gentrification (often housing and demographic shifts) and has relied heavily on the US census (Schwirian 1983), described as the “most comprehensive and comparable source of data” on neighborhood change (Hammel and Wyly 1996, 248). Most quantitative studies of gentrification have taken a “macro,” census-based approach (Hammel and Wyly 1996). Their focus has been the measurement of"

Their focus has been the measurement of demographic shifts over a number of years that indicate gentrification, such as changes in the racial/ethnic composition, income, and educa-tional attainment of residents (Barton 2016). More complex quantitative approaches link noncensus data from large-scale surveys to census measures and geographies. For instance, Freeman (2005) links geocoded data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics (PSID) to decennial census data and ana-lyzes the data at the census tract level to compare displace-ment in gentrifying tracts to low-income tracts that did not gentrify using characteristics such as location, income, and educational attainment. Bostic and Martin (2003) use a simi-lar approach, aggregating 1970–1990 data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act to the census level to study the role of minority groups in the gentrification of neighborhoods. Their research builds on previous work by Wyly and Hammel (1999), who examined gentrification in eight American cities during the 1990s. Studies utilizing census-based quantitative methodolo- gies to measure neighborhood change have given insights about segregation, population dynamics and “tipping points,” neighborhood life cycles, and neighborhood revitalization and gentrification (Schwirian 1983). However, one shortfall of the quantitative approach is that it does not compare cen-sus data with what is actually on the ground, thus not verify-ing census-based findings (Hammel and Wyly 1996, 248).

Additionally, the geography of the census tract is not always ideal to understand neighborhood processes, and aggregated quantitative data at the census tract level may miss subtler changes occurring in neighborhoods. Qualitative work has usually taken a case study or ethno- graphic approach to provide an in-depth look of neighbor - hood change. Such studies typically use a combination of built environment analyses and observations and stakeholder interviews. For instance, in his case study of West Town in Chicago, Betancur (2002) uses interviews, media coverage, and field observations to examine the role of local dialectics of power, class, and race/ethnicity in the process of gentrifi-cation. Brown-Saracino (2009) draws from interviews and ethnographic research in Chicago to identify three types of gentrifiers that have different goals and motivations: urban pioneers, social homesteaders, and social preservationists. Other qualitative studies focus on the opinions of propo- nents or opponents of gentrification. This includes ethno-graphic work on the political discourse of diversity in Rogers Park in Chicago (Berrey 2005), and on grassroots resistance to gentrification in San Francisco’s Tenderloin (Robinson 1995).

Qualitative studies are often richly detailed ethnographic accounts of neighborhood change. They usually focus on a single neighborhood or small group of neighborhoods expe-riencing gentrification due to demographic shifts (Barton 2016). This is the case in several studies of gentrification in New York City neighborhoods (Mele 2000; Freeman 2005; Maurrasse 2006). The very small number of neighborhoods examined typically prevents qualitative research from using control measures for comparison with other neighborhoods. Another shortcoming of qualitative approaches is that they generally do not integrate analyses of census data to verify findings from neighborhood-based fieldwork (Hammel and Wyly 1996). More recently, the volume of neighborhood-level data has increased dramatically. Parcel-level data (from the County Assessors’ office) and business data (e.g., from Dun and Bradstreet) are now easily accessible annually. Researchers can also draw information about neighborhood urban form and its changes from the Street View’s archives of Google Maps, various crowdsourcing data, and the American Community Survey (ACS) annual data. While such informa-tion may be time-consuming to compile, and at times lacks consistency and accuracy, or in the case of ACS, uses limited sample sizes, it nevertheless gives researchers the capability of developing annual neighborhood profiles to assess neigh-borhood trajectories.

An example is the work by Hammel and Wyly (1996), who groundtruth census reports of neighborhood upscaling using field observations of visible housing reinvestment, and the work by Sampson (2012), who collected extensive street-level data from observations of neighborhood social and physical disorder in Chicago. Chapple (2009) also uses a mixed-methods approach to map the Bay Area’s susceptibil-ity to gentrification, employing first quantitative analysis to explore the link of gentrification to the presence of different factors relating to neighborhood location, sociodemograph-ics, housing characteristics, and neighborhood amenities. Based on this work, she later develops an “early warning toolkit” for gentrification, and uses qualitative research to test it in the Lake Merritt neighborhood. Similarly, Hwang and Sampson (2014) examine gentrification in Chicago using a diverse array of quantitative and qualitative data, including census-based indicators, police records, commu-nity surveys, city budget data on capital investments, and built environment observations from Google Street View. The methodology presented in this study draws from this third line of research. It seeks to understand neighborhood change, using a mixed-methods approach that combines sec-ondary data from the census and administrative records, qual-itative observations of residential and commercial ascent, and perceptions of gentrification by stakeholders, often contrast-ing these data to test their accuracy.The"

Gentrification is a hot-button issue in Los Angeles, at a time when housing affordability challenges in the city and in California are “as bad as they’ve ever been” (Dillon 2017). The large majority of new construction takes places around transit stations, where the city has decided to strategically concentrate its new and higher-density development (Loukaitou-Sideris 2007). There is, thus, considerable con-cern that gentrification is lurking at many transit neighbor - hoods in Los Angeles. Los Angeles and its transit neighborhoods represent then a natural selection for studying gentrification pressures. For this study, we chose four station-neighborhoods, which we considered vulnerable to gentrification, because they are occupied by high numbers of low-income/low-education and minority populations. Diversity of station-area conditions also influenced our selection of these neighborhoods, since each of them represents a different land use and demographic mix, and stations (belonging to different lines) were intro-duced into the neighborhoods at different times (see Table 1 for summary statistics of each neighborhood).

Confined into an ethnic enclave by legislation and racial backlash, early Chinese merchants developed family-owned “mom-and-pop” stores. Today, many of these small businesses continue to cater to the shopping needs of residents and visitors, but shopping centers and mini-malls have also popped up over the years. Community groups believe that the area is cur - rently experiencing gentrification as they see transforma-tions, including the loss of traditional businesses and the development of new housing options, public services, and activities that are inconsistent with its historic identity (Figure 1) (Mai and Chen 2013; CCED 2015).

Its station is located directly adjacent to Mariachi Plaza, the commercial center of the area, which since the 1930s has served as a gathering place for mariachi musicians looking for work (Figure 4).

Of course, not all low-income/low education and high-minority neighborhoods are equally vulnerable, as other indicators (e.g., significant or historic architecture, proximity to natural features, etc.) may make a neighborhood appealing to gentri-fiers. However, one of the weaknesses of census tract–level data is that it does not give much information about urban form characteristics or the residents’ lived experiences, which are better captured by qualitative research.

We calculated the change in Section 8 housing voucher recipients from HUD’s Picture of Subsidized Housing database for 2000 and 2013, as well as the number of Ellis Act Evictions from 2007 to 2014 as documented by the City of Los Angeles Housing and Community Investment Department. The Ellis Act allows landlords to evict tenants, if they change the use of their building (e.g., from rental units to condos). Lastly, we used the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) database to calcu- late the change in low-income units between 2000 and 2013.

Two trained researchers per neighborhood collected these data on predesigned recording sheets (see Appendix B). We conducted a series of trial observations to check the appropriateness and validity of the forms and interobserver reliability (Landis and Koch 1977). Researchers walked around the neighborhoods, documenting observations at the street-segment and parcel levels, and photographing each block and parcel aiming to capture a variety of indicators of possible presence or absence of gen-trification. The methodology for observing built environ-ment changes was, in part, adapted from Hwang and Sampson (2014); however, our observations included both commercial and residential parcels, and also sought to document urban form elements explicitly linked to demographic shifts, upscaling, and presence or absence of social disorder. Appendices A to C (online supporting information) show the visual survey instruments. We observed a total of 116 residential and commercial parcels and 84 street segments in the four neighborhoods. We surveyed all blocks immediately adjacent to the station, within a quarter-mile radius and in each cardinal direction, and a smaller sample of blocks within the half-mile radius (but outside of the quarter-mile). For parcel-level analysis, we mapped and visited all parcels with new construction, renovation, condo conversion, or sales to single-family homes, multifamily buildings, and commercial properties between 2008 and 2013.

We, therefore, complemented the secondary data and field observations with interviews with representatives from local CBOs and public agencies active in the four neighborhoods. The part of the interviews relevant for this article centered on the respondents’ perceptions regarding neighborhood change and gentrification, and how the station has impacted the transit neighborhood. We conducted a total of seventeen semistructured inter - views in the four neighborhoods, with representatives from different public agencies (Los Angeles Department of City Planning, neighborhood councils, and city council offices) and ten CBOs active in the neighborhoods (Strategic Alliance for a Just Economy [SAJE], Southeast Asian Community Alliance [SEACA], Chinatown Community for Equitable Development [CCED], Thai Community Development Center [Thai CDC], East Los Angeles Community Corporation [ELACC], Watts Community Studio [WCS], Trust for Public Land [TPL], Union de Vecinos, Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy [LAANE], and LA V oice).

Secondary Data Table 6 summarizes the collected secondary data; it shows changes in the sociodemographic characteristics of the sta-tion-neighborhoods, and how they compare with LA County and All-TOD averages. Data was aggregated to the block groups that fall partially or completely within a half mile of the transit station. All dollar values were adjusted to 2013 dollars. As shown in Table 6, from 2000 to 2013, LA County experienced a decrease of 4 percentage points in white popu-lation, while the four neighborhoods either witnessed a slighter decrease (Mariachi Plaza), no decrease (103rd/Watts), or an increase in non-Hispanic white residents (Hollywood/Western, Chinatown).

Conversion of apartments to condominiums may sig-nify a gentrification trend, but as shown in Table 7, this only happened in significant numbers in the Hollywood/Western neighborhood. There was very little new construction of sin-gle-family residences within the quarter-mile area of all neighborhoods; however, 103rd/Watts witnessed the con-struction of seventy-two single-family houses within the half-mile area. There was a more significant addition of multifamily units in three neighborhoods, mostly outside the quarter-mile but within the half-mile radius from the station. Table 8 summarizes changes in neighborhood affordabil- ity. The four neighborhoods experienced significant drops in the percentage of their affordable housing stock from 2000 to 2013, quite higher than the 13 percent reduction in affordable housing units experienced by the County as a whole. During the same time, the increase in their Section 8 housing was very small (0.5–3.6 percent). With the exception of 103rd/Watts, the other three neighborhoods saw increases in LIHTC Table 5.

Street-level observations also did not reveal signs of commercial gentrification in Chinatown, finding primarily older, estab-lished businesses and no signs of trendy new stores (bou-tiques, yoga studios, high-end grocery stores, or galleries). Some commercial parcels had minor cosmetic renovations (e.g., fresh paint). Observations captured, however, some signs of residential gentrification that were not evident from the secondary data. Chinatown had the highest prevalence of new construction on residential parcels among the four neighborhoods, which may indicate a quickly growing resi-dential market. About one fourth of residential parcels had upscale landscaping, and one fourth were newly renovated.

As stated, “New development and incoming retailers are catering to new resi-dents or more affluent commuters” (SEACA, interview, February 4, 2015). CBOs reported some flipping of commer - cial properties (CCED, interview, April 15, 2015), and noted that business turnover and displacement have led some long-term residents to leave because they no longer feel a cultural and economic connection to Chinatown (SEACA, interview, February 4, 2015). Chinatown CBOs also expressed concerns over the threat to affordable housing units. In the words of one interviewee: “Chinatown has had affordable senior housing since the 1980s, but many of the affordable units have expired or are set to expire, and some affordable senior units are converting into market rate units” (CCED, interview, April 15, 2015).

Conversely, a city planner argued that the new “infrastructure investments are attracting developers to the area interested in turning existing commercial and industrial properties into housing” (LACPD, interview, April 15, 2015). Representatives of CBOs interviewed in the Hollywood/ Western neighborhood underlined the residential gentrifica-tion that the area is experiencing. According to one inter - viewee: “Real estate speculation is forcing long-term, low-income renters out of their neighborhood.” Indeed, the mean rent has increased in this neighborhood by more than 40 percent since 1980. An organizer from LA V oice (an inter - faith local community group) estimated that 30 percent of a Hollywood church congregation has moved to San Fernando Valley because of rising rents in Hollywood (LA V oice, inter - view, April 10, 2015).

CBO and public agency representatives confirmed the lack of noticeable changes near the station. CBOs, however, noted instances of illegal evictions and slum conditions in the wider area of South Los Angeles (SAJE, interview, February 4, 2015). The CBO representa-tives interviewed believe that this station-neighborhood remains underserved, and economic and community devel-opment efforts in the Watts area—a community heavily impacted by the 1965 Watts riots and the 1992 Los Angeles riots—have been largely unsuccessful (LAANE, interview, February 13, 2015), which may explain the reluctance of wealthier residents to move in and the absence of gentrifica-tion. According to a planner interviewed: “In Watts, there has been little development around the Blue Line. Unlike in many areas where [rail] transit has come in, transit has not been a draw. The area is lacking in services, business, [mix of] uses, jobs, and housing” (LACPD, interview, April 15, 2015). At Mariachi Plaza, CBOs expressed concerns that a grow- ing number of new neighborhood businesses are not catering to the needs of long-term residents. As noted “since the open-ing of the station, Mariachi Plaza and its weekly market are increasingly being marketed for cultural tourism.

The zoning where these stores are located does not lead to a financially attractive use of land for developers” (LACPD, interview, April 15, 2015). Data Triangulation In addition to getting a deeper understanding of gentrifica-tion processes in the four neighborhoods, we also sought to compare and contrast the data gathered by different methods and test the accuracy of secondary data. Thus, we used data triangulation to compare the secondary data to the primary data collected through field observations. Specifically, we examined the consistency between Assessor’s data on land uses, residential improvements, and new construction with data collected from field observations. Table 9 shows the level of consistency between the Assessor’s data and observed data about residential land uses. We found a signifi-cant inconsistency in Hollywood/Western and some incon-sistency in Chinatown between the assessed and observed single-family homes. We defined a “major residential improvement” as one where extensive renovation was visible, which would have likely required a building permit.

Loukaitou-Sideris et al. 239 What Did We Learn about Gentrification? So what did we learn about each neighborhood in regard to gentrification? We found that gentrification is a complex and context-specific phenomenon that cannot be simply captured by one indicator. Take for example rent burden. Simple sta-tistics cannot easily capture change because the initial wave of higher-income residents who benefit from existing rent levels could keep the rent-to-income ratio low, or even lower it. At the same time, existing census information is not suf-ficient because it does not depict the fine-grain changes, such as the number of individuals displaced. We can only indi-rectly get a sense of that, and the better data (such as evic-tions) are not readily available across jurisdictions. Given this complexity and disparate trajectories, it is important to have multiple indicators of gentrification. Table 12 is a visual representation of how different gentri- fication indicators in the four neighborhoods (gathered from the three methods) compare to County trends. Taking into account these indicators, we can tell that the 103rd /Watts neighborhood has not gentrified, the Hollywood/Western neighborhood is at a late stage of gentrification, while Chinatown and Mariachi Plaza exhibit early stages of gentrification.In addition to using multiple indicators, it is also impor - tant to employ different methodologies to measure these indicators. This is shown in"

This is shown in Table 13, which summarizes the assessment from each method. We can see that in two neigh-borhoods, where gentrification was either clearly visible or clearly absent, the assessment of all three methods con-verged. Indeed 103rd/Watts has not experienced gentrifica-tion, while Hollywood/Western has experienced significant commercial and residential gentrification near its station. On the other hand, the assessment of the presence or absence of gentrification was somewhat different depending on the method in two other neighborhoods. In Chinatown, the sec-ondary data showed only signs of residential gentrification at the southwest edges of the neighborhood; visual surveys showed also some additional residential gentrification closer to the station; while the interviews confirmed the observa-tions but also revealed the flipping of some commercial properties and early signs of commercial gentrification. Lastly, the secondary data did not reveal residential or com-mercial gentrification at Mariachi Plaza. However, observa-tions and interviews with CBOs pointed to early signs of both residential and commercial gentrification. It should be noted, however, that some planners interviewed disputed that commercial gentrification is taking place in this neighborhood. Conclusion This study used a mixed-methods approach to “drill in” the topic of gentrification in four transit neighborhoods. It showed that gentrification is a fluid process that cannot be captured by one indicator or one source of data. The employ-ment of a mixed-methods approach offered a"

But secondary data cannot always tell us what is on the ground, such as new or unpermitted renovations that community resi-dents can see but are not reflected in the Assessor’s data, or different merchandise or increased prices that some busi- nesses may enact in response to a new clientele. As our trian- gulation exercise showed, in areas of significant change, secondary data may not always give a fully accurate picture of changes in the built environment and current land uses. Planners should not assume that secondary data are always precise, and should carefully evaluate such data for anoma-lies before using them in models. Systematic field observations can give a wealth of informa- tion about a neighborhood’s urban form and social activities at the parcel and street level, and can help groundtruth secondary data. In this study, observations revealed some visual signs of gentrification such as new “hipster” establishments, and new buildings that were more upscale than their surroundings. Field observations, however, cannot capture numerical changes in neighborhood demographics or real estate transactions, which are better identified by secondary data. Unless field observa-tions are compared with data sources that give information about the past context of a neighborhood (e.g., street-level pho- tographs, aerial photographs of previous"

Collection of primary data is also tedious and time-consuming, and for this reason, cannot easily cover large geographic areas. Lastly, visual observations may at times be inadequate to distinguish between housing types, such as condos versus apartment complexes, and may require Table 12.

Field observations require significant train- ing of the individuals undertaking them, as well as the prepara-tion of detailed guidelines and survey templates (see Appendices A to C in online supporting information) for different assess-ments of the urban form to avoid inconsistencies among the different field surveyors. Interviews with knowledgeable local stakeholders can help uncover information about neighborhood change that is not available in secondary data or readily visible by field observations. Those on the ground may be knowledgeable of patterns of change that are not captured by other data sources. Thus, our interviewees gave anecdotal evidence of, for exam-ple, what is happening at particular Chinatown or Mariachi Plaza stores that seem to target new incoming residents or tourists, and parishioners in an interviewee’s congregation, who have left Hollywood/Western because of rising rents. Data from interviews, however, are subjective and may reflect the biases, priorities, advocacy, and broader concerns of the observer, interviewer, and interviewees. Therefore, such data also need to be triangulated and solicited by different groups that may have differentiated or even opposing views. As other researchers have argued, gentrification is a dynamic process that has different stages (Kerstein 1990).

This study showed that an examina-tion of neighborhood change based only on secondary data is likely adequate for neighborhoods that either do not have signs of gentrification or experience a late stage of gentrifi-cation. However, the employment of only secondary data may lead to inaccurate assessments, if a neighborhood is at an early stage of gentrification. In such cases, planners will do well to complement secondary data with qualitative meth-odologies, visit the neighborhood, groundtruth the census data, and even hear from local stakeholders.Neighborhoods evolve and change over time in com- plex and different ways. We often encounter discrepancies in indicators and beliefs about the nature and extent of neighborhood change. This is due to the complexity of identifying, measuring, and characterizing change, but also the existence of different information sets, and even the inaccuracy of some data sources. While small inaccu-racies and discrepancies may not matter much when data show a clear presence or absence of gentrification, they may lead to wrong assumptions if gentrification is in early stages. In such cases, the utilization of multiple indicators and data sources that involve both secondary data as well as empirical work such as field observations and stake-holder interviews complement each other and can give a more complete picture of neighborhood change brought about by"
