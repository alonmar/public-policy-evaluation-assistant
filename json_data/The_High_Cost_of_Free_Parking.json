Even for m any transportation prof essionals and urban plan ners, parking tends to be little m ore than an afterthought. Bu t a m ajor new treatise by UCLA pr ofessor Donald Shoup makes a strong case for more attention to parking. Shoup determ ines that in the United States, off-street parking consum es an area roughly the size of Connecticut. If global car ownership rates catch up with those in the U.S., and assum ing just one of f-street space per car, an area the size of England would need to be paved to house the world’s car fleet (d uring the 95 percent of the day when it’s not on the road). Shoup contends that m any of the woes associat ed with Am erica’s car culture can be linked direc tly to th e lack of rational attentio n to pa rking.

In fact, trans portation suffers from the sam e “tragedy of the commons” relative to parking observed with regard to fisheries and ot her free and un-owned resources. Zoning requirem ents for overly-abundant off-street parking and failure to charge appropriately for curb parking result in extra air pollu tion, higher oil consum ption, tra ffic congestion, and sprawl. Less obviously, parking requirements increase the cost o f housing, as w ell as goods and services . For urban areas, Shoup summarizes these eff ects quoting Mum ford: “The right to have access to ev ery building in the city b y private m otorcar in an age when ev eryone possesses such a vehicle, is actually th e right to destroy the city.” For those w ho don’t have the tim e to read The High Cost of F ree Parking’s hefty 700 pages, we have summ arized Shoup’s m ajor findings into th ree sections following the outline of his book: zoning codes’ influence on th e proliferation of free park ing, the cruising-f or-parking phenom enon, and Shoup’s policy recommendations.

Shoup says “city planners som etimes mistake Pa ndora’s box for a toolkit.” With the best of intentions, planners have “cured” parking shortages with a tonic that has m ade m atters worse. The practice of setting of f-street parking requir ements in city zoning codes has becom e fully entrenched. Even for low-incom e housing projects where a m ajority of residen ts can ’t afford a private vehicle, zoning codes require vast pa rking lots to m eet a dem and that will nev er materialize. Those lots not only add to the cost of a developm ent, they also require that land which could otherwise be used for housing (or la ndscaping, etc). Overall, parking requirem ents increase the cost and diminish the supply of hous ing, and this effect is not lim ited just to low- incom e developm ents. A San Francisco study f ound that requirem ents for off-street parking increased housing prices by an average of $47,000 and increased the household incom e necessary to purchase a hous e from $67,000 annually to $76,000.

The second solution, reducing dem and, offers devel opers a cost-effective a lternative to building more parkin g.

The first obstacle is relatively easy to address. Shoup desc ribes several new takes on the traditional parking m eter, which was invented by a m ember of the Oklaho ma City Chamber of Comm erce in 1935. Most Am erican parking m eters haven’t changed m uch in the 70 years since. But recen t years hav e seen significant advances. Pay-and-display and pay-by-space mete rs are used in New York City, Aspen and Berkeley and differ from traditiona l meters in th at they contro l multiple spa ces. They also have the benef it of allowing cash, credit card, sm art card and even cell phone paym ents. Personal in-vehicle m eters, also em ployed by Aspen and in Arlington, VA, allo w parkers to pay without stepping out of their cars. Drivers key the appropriate parking zone, insert their pa rking sm art card, and display the meter in the windshield. Paym ent is deducted un til the dr iver return s and switches of f the m eter.

In several E uropean cities, drivers pay for parki ng with their cell phones by calling a city parking number and keying in license plat e and parking zone (cell paym ent is also a popular way to pay London’s congestion charge). An in-vehicle trans ponder allows control officers to determ ine if the car is paying and parked lega lly. The EU is also exploring using Global Positioning System satellites to pay for parking. Beyond their convenience, the principal advantages of modern paym ent m ethods is that parking rates can be adjusted to respond to dem and. Duri ng peak parking periods, rates can be adjusted upward to ensure a rough balance between suppl y and dem and, reducing som e trips and also cutting back on cruising for parking. Of course the bigger obstacle to charging for parking (evident in the recent tem pest over NYC metered Sunday parking) is politics . Resistance to increasing park ing rates and putting a price on previously free parking is strong. Shoup says it can be overcom e via park ing benefit districts .
