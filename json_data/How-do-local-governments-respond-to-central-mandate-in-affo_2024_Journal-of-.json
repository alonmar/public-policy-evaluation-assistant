Introduction The question of how to provide decent and affordable housing for middle-to-low-income residents has challenged policymakers and planners of many countries for decades ( Bratt, 2018 ). In recent years, national and state governments have attempted to use various forms of political or legal mandates to improve local affordable housing production ( Austin et al., 2014 ;Clegg&Farstad, 2021 ;Mitra, 2022 ;Goetz&Wang, 2020 ). These mandates represent a coercive approach compelling local authority to implement measures for affordable housing development, such as augmenting housing units or enhancing inclusivity. Local authorities would face a series of legally or ﬁscally punishment or sanctions if they don't respond to these mandates as required. Existing literature has focused on the extent to which these top-down mandates have or have not successfully increased the overall stock of affordable housing ( Goetz &Wang, 2020 ;Karki, 2015 ). Some scholars have revealed that “hard”mandates compel local * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: cu222014@cupl.edu.cn (L. Ma), zhilinliu@tsinghua.edu.cn (Z.

However, others still question the effectiveness of these mandates by pointing out the housing exclusion, uneven distribution of inclusionary affordable housing, and symbolic implementation in responding to the housing elements ( Lewis, 2005 ;Li&Guo, 2020 ;Smith&Byrne, 2021 ). Such controversy implies the necessity to further investigate how local governments speci ﬁcally respond to the mandate. Examining local governments ’response to housing mandate requires clari ﬁcation on two fronts. First, housing policy is complicated and multifaceted. Successful implementation of housing policy hinges not only on augmenting the quantity of affordable housing, but also encompasses diverse facets such as housing quality, housing location, long-term management ( Jonkman et al., 2022 ;R .Liu&Wong, 2015 ;Z .Ma et al., 2018 ;Y .Xiao et al., 2020 ). While a few case studies have discussed local response actions in certain aspects ( Ebe- kozien, 2021 ;Hansson, 2019 ), a comprehensive conceptual framework delineating local actions in response to housing mandates is yet to be established systematically. Second, local governments are embedded in a social, political and cultural environment that in ﬂuences the form and content of their behavior ( Gonz /C19alez&Healey, 2005 ). Therefore, local governments choose their actions based on their own interpretation and adap- tation in response to the pressure imposed by the top-down"

Such process entails an examination of the congruence of both top-down political pressure and multiple local factors that eventually shapes local strategic responses to a political mandate. This research thus aims to contribute to these intellectual gaps with an empirical study of local responses to an affordable housing mandate issued by the central government during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011 –2015). In 2011, the central government announced the ambitious goal to construct 36 million units of affordable housing within ﬁve years (2011 –2015). This mandate was accompanied by a combination of increased ﬁscal subsidy and heightened political accountability to compel local government compliance to ful ﬁll the numeric construction target.

Our research contributes to the literature on housing policy in two fronts. First, we provided a three-dimensional framework for conceptualizing and quantitatively measuring local strategic responses to a top-down housing mandate, which extends beyond the traditional single-dimension approach to view local implementation equal to ful ﬁlling a numeric number of housing construction (Hansson, 2019 ;Hoch, 2007 ;Yu&Xu, 2022 ). Second, by adopting the fsQCA method, our research are able to identify various combinations of various top-down and local factors that may contribute to more diverse local policy actions in affordable housing, rather than typical regression models that only focus on independent effect of each causal factor ( Agyemang &Morrison, 2018 ;Goetz&Wang, 2020 ;Hu&Qian, 2017 ).

Therefore, local governments had no incentive to construct affordable housing because they had to fund affordable housing provision directly with their own budget, or indirectly through waiving land-leasing fees and real estate-related taxes and fees that could have been charged on commercial housing projects ( Hu&Qian, 2017 ). In the pursuit of enhancing local affordable housing development, China's central government established ambitious targets, aiming to construct 36 million affordable housing units between 2011 and 2015. This initiative also outlined key planning principles con- cerning funding, management, and allocation procedures for affordable housing projects within the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. Rati ﬁed by the National People's Congress, the Five-Year Plan's contents and primary objectives underscore the government's dedication to the public ( Yuan&Zuo, 2011 ). Moreover, as the most important government document of China, it offers guidelines and development strategies of the whole country which will be implemented by all levels of subnational governments ( Guilhot, 2022 ;Yuan&Zuo, 2011 ). Accordingly, the section addressing affordable housing development within the Twelfth Five-Year Plan evolved into a top-down mandate, necessitating local actions to achieve the overarching goal of resolving housing challenges.

First, this was a strong mandate with signi ﬁcant political pressure on local leaders. The central government attached political accountability (in Chinese, xingzheng wenze) with the performance targets. Because local leaders ’political promotion was tied to their performance evaluation controlled by upper-level governments ( Xu, 2011 ), the latter stipulated that the leader of lower-level government were to be held accountable –i.e., disci- plined, suspended, or even directly removed from of ﬁce–for failing to achieve the construction target within a pre-determined time frame ( General Of ﬁce of State Council, 2011 No.45). City of ﬁcials faced performance evaluation and accountability from the provincial government, which will be evaluated by the MOHURD. In terms of ﬁnancial outlay, according to the data from Ministry of Finance during 2011-2016, the central assistant of the affordable housing nearly doubled from 73.1 billion yuan in 2010 to 144.4 billion yuan in 2011, which further increased to a high of 216.7 billion 387L.

The increased central government fund prompted provincial governments to follow suit and expand provincial housing funds, leading to dramatic increase of the overall government expenditure on affordable housing. The amount of subsidy a city received was based on the city's committed target of affordable housing construction, therefore offering a monetary incentive for local governments to comply with the mandate. 3. Hard target and beyond: Understanding City's actions In China, the central government has widely adopted top-down mandate as its tool to achieve policy objectives. Given the hierar- chical nature of China's administrative system, previous studies have predominantly examined local responses to central mandates through the lens of central-local relationship, and identi ﬁed the incentive mechanism and the supervision from the central government as crucial factors ( Anderson et al., 2019 ;Kostka &Nahm, 2017 ;Ran, 2013 ;S .Xiao&Zhu, 2021 ). In cases where mandates lack suf ﬁcient ﬁnancial and political incentives but demand signi ﬁcant local resource inputs, local governments are not motivated to comply ( Gong& Wu, 2012 ;Ran, 2013 ). This, coupled with the information asymmetry resulting from weak monitoring of central government, will lead to various implementation biases such as passive resistance, selective implementation, or symbolic implementation ( Fan&Yang, 2019b ; Gong&Wu, 2012 ;Y .Huang, 2012 ;O'Brien"

Under this situation, the central government has enhanced the incentives and supervision via various approaches, including target- oriented responsibility system, central inspection system, third-party monitors (the public or NGOs) ( Anderson et al., 2019 ;Gao, 2015 ; Jia&Chen, 2019 ;Z .Liu et al., 2021 ). Some scholars have observed that these measures prompt local governments to respond more actively to central mandates, as evidenced by signi ﬁcant improvements in response intensity, response speed, and the degree of completion of quantitative targets (Z. Liu et al., 2021 ;Y .Ma, 2021 ;S .Xiao&Zhu, 2021 ). However, improvements in response do not necessarily equate to the achievement of policy objectives especially in complex policy ﬁelds like housing policy, poverty-alleviation policy and environment policy. These policies tend to be complicated, ambiguous, and multifaceted, necessitating long-term resource investment by governments, making the implementation process complex and chal- lenging (C. K. Cai et al., 2022 ;Manna &Mofﬁtt, 2021 ;Plutzer et al., 2019 ). Even when the central government sets strict assessment targets, it cannot dictate all the actions of local governments for implementation (G. Kostka, 2016 ;Zhang et al., 2013 ). In fact, several studies have revealed the hard targets often lead local governments to focus solely on meeting targets within limited timeframes,resulting in unintended consequences such as unmet policy objectives, resource wastage,"

In the realm of housing policy, existing literature has primarily focused on examining local responses to affordable housing mandates by assessing the quantity of affordable housing constructed. This assessment often involves metrics such as the number of housing unitsor utilizing ﬁscal expenditure and land supply dedicated to affordable housing as proxies ( Goetz&Wang, 2020 ;Hu&Qian, 2017 ;Z .Liu et al., 2021 ;Sun, 2020 ). However, simply concentrating on the quantity of affordable housing construction may overlook the quality of housing provided, and the overall well-being of residents living in affordable housing ( Ramsey-Musolf, 2017 ,2018 ), so as to produce unsatisfactory housing projects (Z. Ma et al., 2018 ;Y .Xu&Luo, 2021 ). Moreover, focusing on the short-term construction targets, typically imposed through top-down mandates, could also divert resources away from local institutional and capacity building toward long-term policy implementation ( Rudolf et al., 2017 ). Therefore, understanding local responses to central mandate calls for a framework that encompasses a broad spectrum of local actions including not only actions on the ful ﬁllment of hard targets, but also actions in favor of satisfactory policy outcomes and improving local long-term institutions.

We accordingly propose an three-dimensional framework for understanding local response to the national affordable housing mandate. Procedure formalization . These actions pertain to efforts aimed at improving procedures to ful ﬁll the quantitative construction target. City governments have to respond to the top-down hard mandate both in form and in content under the political pressure of the target assessment ( Fan&Yang, 2019a ). The common practices include setting up an inter-departmental leading group to coordinate various departments, mobilizing and investing all kinds of required resources, expediting procedural work, convening frequent working meetings, and inspecting the implementation progress by leaders (N. N. Liu et al., 2015 ;Tan et al., 2021 ;F .Wang et al., 2022 ). All these measures involve hastening the planning and construction procedures through political pressure and administrative mobilization, ensuring the timely ful ﬁllment of annual affordable housing targets. Outcome improvement . This refers to actions in favor of improving policy outcome and achieving policy goals. The intricacies of social policies like housing policy, adaptation policy, and poverty alleviation policy determines that meeting quantitative targets doesn't automatically translate to achieving policy goals.

A con ﬁgurational perspective on local response to housing mandate Within the central-local dynamic in China, the implementation of most mandates encounters principal-agent problems. The central government formulates and issues the housing mandate as the principal, with the aim of solving the housing dif ﬁculties of middle-to- low-income households. Local governments, serving as agents, are tasked with implementing these mandates under top-down political pressure. However, the central government affords considerable autonomy to localities in determining speci ﬁc implementation ap- proaches. As a result, local governments have the discretion to interpret and undertake actions to implement the mandate based on local conditions ( Miao&Li, 2017 ;Zhuo et al., 2022 ). Consequently, local actions can be regarded as the composite outcome of interpretation on the mandates, local implementation capacity as well as external circumstances, which are re ﬂected in three dimensions. Firstly, different interpretations of policy mandates serve as guides for their speci ﬁc responsive actions ( Deyle&Smith, 1998 ). Existing literature has proved that local governments often perceive unfunded mandates as burdensome and therefore exhibit reluctance in implementing them ( Gong&Wu, 2012 ). However, if local governments align policy mandates with their own development agendas, it enhances the core value of these mandates. This alignment prompts local governments to elevate their level of attention and actively take corresponding actions to"

        "text": "of these mandates. This alignment prompts local governments to elevate their level of attention and actively take corresponding actions to ensure effective policy implementation. For instance, both Genia Kostka and Hobbs (2012) andMiao and Li (2017) have found that local governments would respond more actively to central mandates by bundling and associating their actions with other developmental agendas and co-bene ﬁts. Therefore, this study contends that if local governments consciously bundle the interpretation and elucidation of central mandates for affordable housing construction with their local development agendas, they will possess stronger intrinsic motivation to undertake more diverse actions that foster the integrated development of affordable housing. Secondly, local implementation capacity has been proved to be crucial for local implementation. Executing diverse actions in a short timeframe necessitates the ability of local governments to swiftly mobilize resources. Fiscal capacity, among various resources pertinent to affordable housing development, has been empirically af ﬁrmed as a critical factor in ﬂuencing the actions of local governments ( Butler et al., 2021 ;Goetz&Wang, 2020 ;Zhuo et al., 2022 ). Fiscal resources serve as the foundation and assurance for policy implementation by local governments. Empirical studies have revealed limited ﬁscal capacity may impede local governments from undertaking comprehensive and widespread actions, pushing them towards noncompliance or low-quality implementation ( Berke et al., 2014 ; Homsy &Warner, 2015 ).

Research on the implementation of affordable housing policies in the United States has highlighted ﬁnancial issues as a signi ﬁcant reason for non-compliance by local governments ( Karki, 2015 ;Ramsey-Musolf, 2017 ). Consequently, cities with stronger ﬁscal capacity are more likely to undertake diverse actions in response to the housing mandate. Thirdly, the external circumstances can exert pressure on local governments to take diverse actions. On the one hand, while local governments are typically driven by the incentive to “be accountable to the higher-level government ”(B. A. Huang &Wiebrecht, 2021 ), public dissatisfaction stemming from livelihood issues, particularly rapid increases in housing prices and inadequate housing afford- ability, can pose threats to social stability and political legitimacy. The pressure arising from these societal concerns can in ﬂuence the actions of local governments when responding to policy mandates ( Hu&Qian, 2017 ;Yu&Xu, 2022 ). X.Cai and Wu (2019) has pointed out that when governments perceive a high public demand, they will actively implement the policy to have a positive policy outcome. Owing to the underlying objective of affordable housing mandate is to satisfy the housing demand of residents with housing dif ﬁculties, if a city faces severe issues regarding the affordability of housing and there's strong social demand for affordable housing, local gov- ernments might take more proactive measures to develop and enhance affordable housing policies to address local housing problems. Furthermore, besides the social pressure from public demand,"

Furthermore, besides the social pressure from public demand, another pressure comes from the central government. Studies indicate that mandates from the central government not only establish policy objectives and rules for local government actions but also provide resources such as funding, data, and technical assistance to motivate local governments to take more actions ( Homsy &Warner, 2015 ; Laurian et al., 2017 ). In the context of affordable housing mandate, although local governments face similar top-down construction pressures, the level of support and attention they receive varies. To address funding issues concerning affordable housing construction, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the State Council designated 28 cities as pilot cities for affordable housing construction supported by housing provident funds in August 2010. These pilot cities are obligated not only to rigorously adhere to the usage of project loan funds but also to strictly comply with requirements for the construction, distribution, and management of affordable housing. The central government speci ﬁcally conducts supervision and inspections of affordable housing projects in these pilot cities ( Guo et al., 2021 ). Consequently, compared to cities not included in the pilot program, those designated as pilot cities are more proactive in implementing a diverse range of actions during the “Twelfth Five-Year Plan ”period.

Based on the discussion above, we specify four conditions that in ﬂuence cities ’responsive actions: (1) policy interpretation as urban agenda; (2) ﬁscal capacity; (3) social pressure from housing issues; (4) pressures from higher authorities. 5. Research design 5.1. Method These four contributing factors play a crucial role in the process of municipal responding to central affordable housing mandate. It is insufﬁcient and oversimpli ﬁed to attribute complex policy responses to the impact of individual factors and to overlook the interplay of contributing factors. Consequently, we propose adopting a con ﬁgurational theorizing perspective to analyze interactions among four conditions using fsQCA. FsQCA offers three key facets that facilitate con ﬁgurational studies ( Schneider &Wagemann, 2012 ). Firstly, equi ﬁnality suggests that addressing policy issues can be achieved through various viable and equally effective choices ( Yan et al., 2021 ). There might be multiple pathways for cities to adopt more or less diverse responsive actions. Second, conjunctural causation clari ﬁes that outcomes areL. Ma, Z.

Third, asymmetric causation denotes that appropriate and deﬁcient performance of conditions have different explanations ( Fiss, 2011 ). It implies that the combinations of factors driving more diverse responsive actions may be different from the combinations prompting less diverse actions. 5.2. Data:Source and measurement 5.2.1. Outcome While formal policy documents are the ideal data source for analyzing local responsive actions, severe data de ﬁciencies make systematic content analysis of policy texts impractical and cross-locality comparisons challenging. Therefore, we capture local responsive actions from daily newspapers. Firstly, daily newspapers offer high continuity and accessibility, making them suitable for long-term retrospective studies and detailed descriptions of past events. Their data completeness and richness also effectively address the issue of missing data. Secondly, local daily newspapers are sponsored and issued by the municipal party committee, serving as a tool for the government and party committee to publicize programs, development guidelines, and policies. Its content thus can largely re ﬂect local policy attention, the actions the government decides to take or what actions it has taken. Thirdly, since the city's ultimate per- formance in implementing affordable housing matters more than its propaganda, there is no motivation to conceal preferences in the daily newspaper. The information within it genuinely conveys perceptions and actions taken in"

Municipalities directly under the central government are not included in this part because of their administrative status equivalent to provincial governments. Among the rest of twenty- ﬁve provinces, cities are selected following three principles. Firstly, we aim to ensure regional diversity. Given the substantial regional variations in the implementation of affordable housing policies in China, as highlighted in existing literature ( Hu& Qian, 2017 ;Z .Liu et al., 2021 ), we make an effort to encompass all provinces and regions in our case selections. We next consider the comparability of the cases. We intentionally choose cities where the committed affordable housing units per capita ranked in the top 25% in at least one of the ﬁve years during 2011 –2015. The purpose is to control their quantitative performance in affordable housing mandate for a more robust comparison of local actions. Lastly, we have to ensure the city's daily newspapers are available and have no absence during our targeted period. Due to the absence of any cities ranking in the top 25% in Hainan Province and"

After manual reading and veriﬁcation, news reports that do not re ﬂect the city-level situation were eliminated, and ﬁnally 1795 news reports were obtained. On average, each city has 44 news reports.

We focused on speciﬁc actions mentioned in the coverage and eliminated the discourse like slogans, principled statements, or descriptions of the construction progress functioning as propaganda. We coded the texts through manual reading and understanding by judging whether the content in each news report mentioned any action. Speci ﬁcally, the news report of this city scored 1 once it did. The scores for each news report were added together to produce a city's scores on every third-level indicator. One author conducted the coding twice respectively in 2020 and 2023. The percentage of agreement among the two coding is 92.1%, and the Cohen's kappa value is 0.754. We ﬁnally obtained every city's annual scores for each action (third-level indicator), from which the scores for each category (second-level indicator), and each dimension ( ﬁrst-level indicator) were summed. To further measure the diversity of city's responsive actions, we used an indicator in the literature for breadth or diversity - Shannon entropy ( Guan&Rowe, 2016 ). Entropy refers to the inherent disorder within a system. To compute Shannon entropy, we ﬁrst calculated the proportion of each indicator score to the total score ( Pj), then used the Shannon entropy formula to obtain the Shannon entropy of responsive actions for each city."

A higher value of S indicates that the city's actions across various indicators are more extensive, re ﬂecting a more diverse range of actions in procedure formalization, outcome improvement, and institution building. Conversely, a lower value indicates a lower extent of diversity in the city's actions, where actions primarily focus on a few indicators. This might imply potential issues of being too selective or lacking comprehensive approaches in their actions. 5.2.2.

Although the higher-level government provides some ﬁnancial support for affordable housing, cities still need to input local ﬁscal resources ( Zou, 2014 ). Therefore, ﬁscal revenue is the most direct indicator of ﬁscal capacity. To mitigate the in ﬂuence of population size, the author standardized local ﬁscal revenue using the city's resident population (in thousands).

The fuzzy set calibration process determined which original condition values constituted complete membership (membership score ¼1), complete non-membership (membership score ¼0), and crossover point (membership score ¼0.5) within the respective categories.

The truth table was consolidated based on two principles: (1) at least one case required in a given con ﬁguration for a solution to be considered, and (2) a minimum consistency level of 0.80 for a given solution ( Fiss, 2011 ). Consistency, ranging from 0 to 1, indicated the extent to which cases sharing a combination of conditions consistently yield the key outcome. Lower consistency suggested an unreliable relationship between a con ﬁguration and the outcome, whereas higher consistency implied that a speci ﬁc con ﬁguration of factors almost always leads to the desired outcome ( Misangyi &Acharya, 2014 ). Despite different choices in reporting complex and intermediate solutions ( Andrews et al., 2019 ;W .J .

The descriptive statistics reveal the complexity and multidimensionality of actions taken by city governments. Their focus extends beyond merely meeting construction targets within tight timelines; they also engage in diverse response actions. Firstly, the dimension of “outcome improvement ”involving actions concerning the housing policy effect attains the highest overall score.

This aligns with additional requirements from the central government, emphasizing speci ﬁc aspects of policy beyond strict assessments based solely on construction quantity. For instance, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development speci ﬁcally issued the “Notice on Strengthening the Quality Management of Affordable Housing Projects ”in 2011, emphasizing the reinforcement of quality management and ensuring project quality. Moreover, in the National Government Work Reports from 2011 to 2015, the establishment and improvement of the mechanism for the allocation and exit of affordable housing were mentioned almost every year. Secondly, city governments still undertake numerous actions of “procedure formalization ”which aiming at ensuring the ful ﬁlment of construction tasks, especially actions revolving around completing mandatory targets. However, the overall low score of “institution building ”indicates the inadequate actions in establishing and developing a local long-term affordable housing system. More importantly, the responsive actions vary signi ﬁcantly across cities. The eastern cities place greater emphasis on the effec- tiveness of implementing affordable housing policies and local housing system building. For example, Table 2 shows their focus on supporting facilities for affordable housing and the coverage scope of housing security is higher than central and western cities. This implies that, apart from the construction targets of affordable housing, eastern cities also allocate substantial resources to ensure the housing and living needs"

In comparison, western cities place more emphasis on achieving quanti ﬁable targets, scoring signi ﬁcantly higher than the average in all categories of “procedure formalization ” to ensure the completion of affordable housing construction tasks within a limited timeframe. The central cities exhibit noticeable deﬁciencies in actions concerning local affordable housing institutional development, with very low scores across various indicators. 6.2. Analysis of single conditions Before deriving the con ﬁgurations of conditions using the truth table in fsQCA, it's essential to verify whether individual condition variables (including their negations) are necessary conditions for the outcome variable ( Ragin, 2009 ). In QCA computations, assessing the consistency indicator can determine if a condition is necessary. A consistency indicator exceeding 0.9 indicates that the condition is necessary for the outcome ( Young &Park, 2013 ).Table 3 reveals that when analyzing the necessity of conditions —including bundling affordable housing with local development agendas, ﬁscal capacity, housing affordability, and being selected as a pilot city —regarding the diversity of action, the consistency of each condition is below 0.9. Thus, the four conditions selected in this study do not individually constitute necessary conditions for the outcome. Furthermore, the analysis of the necessity of non-sets of these four conditions similarly demonstrates that the absence of any single condition"

We include measures of consistency and coverage for each con ﬁguration and for the solution as a whole. Coverage assesses the degree to which instances of the outcome of interest are accounted for by a given path and by the solution as a whole. Unique coverage explains memberships in the outcome not covered by other con ﬁgurations. No minimum level of coverage is required in QCA analyses ( Yan et al., 2021 ). We present our ﬁndings by characterizing the three pathways of more diverse actions as “enterprising ”,“reactive ”,“supportive ” (Table 4 ), and two pathways of less diverse actions as “selective ”, and “deﬁcient ”(Table 5 ), respectively. 6.3.1. Pathway 1: “Enterprising ” Theﬁrst pathway to more diverse response actions involves a con ﬁguration where the internal willingness, superior pressure and local capacity exist except internal social pressure for housing. Kunming took this pathway, showing diverse actions in developing affordable housing. As the capital city of Yunnan Province, Kunming is not in extreme lack of ﬁscal resources. Facing the top-down affordable housing mandate, it aligned affordable housing development with urban construction rather than regarded it only as a political mandate or economic propeller. More importantly, Kunming accepted the special inspection of MHUD as a pilot city for the affordable housing construction and development in 2011 (Kunming"

Pathway 2: “Reactive ” The second con ﬁguration, represented by Xiamen and Fuzhou, comprises of external and internal pressure, along with local capacity. Similar to the ﬁrst pathway, Xiamen and Fuzhou, as pilot city, underwent special inspections by the central government for the affordable housing project. Their actions in developing affordable housing received heightened attention and more requirements from the superior government. In addition, these cities face relatively serious housing affordability problems, and the resulting social demand will also affect the actions of local governments to responding to the affordable housing policy mandate. Therefore, in response to internal and external pressures and with suf ﬁcient resources, the city will try to take various and extensive actions in the implementing affordable housing policies to make the project achieve more desirable outcomes, including focusing on housing design, quality,location and supporting facilities and other aspects. 6.3.3.

The representing cases are Guangzhou and Nanjing, which are both economically developed cities with suf ﬁcient resources but severe housing issues. Notably, both of them have interpreted the mandate and embraced the development of affordable housing into urban agenda. For example, Guangzhou believes that “strengthening affordable housing construction is a need to enhance the core competitiveness of the city ”(Guangzhou Daily, 2011-05- 18), while Nanjing put forward “make it (affordable housing) a major feature to attract and retain talents ” (Nanjing Daily, 2011-09-09). Therefore, this pathway shows the city's own support of developing affordable housing. 6.3.4. Pathway 4: “Selective ” The“selective ”pathway to the adoption of less diverse response actions has involved the absence of both internal social pressure and external superior pressure, as well as the presence of local willingness and capacity. The city that took this pathway was Yueyang. Without severe housing affordability issues and strict central inspection, it didn't have much pressure. Therefore, although affordable housing was interpreted by a project associated with city image, its actions didn't comprehensively cover most items. Speci ﬁcally, it focused more on improving the effect of affordable housing policy and building long-term housing system. Overall, their response actions to the affordable housing mandate was “selective ”. 6.3.5. Pathway 5: “Deﬁcient"

Pathway 5: “Deﬁcient ” Xining was one city that adopted different kind of less diverse response actions, this was distinguished by strong internal willingness, social pressure and superior pressure but weak implementation capacity. Xining had strong desire to develop affordable housing by regarding it as the sally port for promoting the transformation of old city proper and improving urban functions. It also faced internal social pressure for solving housing affordability problems as well as external inspection pressure as a pilot city. However, the weak ﬁscal capacity constrained it to take diverse actions in affordable housing policy implementation. In especial, it concentrated mainly on making efforts to mobilize resources and simplifying the administration procedures to increase ef ﬁciency to ful ﬁl the construction tasks with limited time and resources. The absence of ﬁscal capacity generally reinforced the “deﬁcient ”approach. 7. Conclusions and policy implications Understanding local actions is crucial for studying policy implementation and the effectiveness of housing mandates. Although the housing mandate attract local attention and exert pressure of developing affordable housing with strict quantitative target assessment, city governments retain a degree of ﬂexibility. Their actions in response to the top-down mandate are taken based on their interpre- tation, local capacity, social and superior pressure they feel.

Liu Journal of Urban Management 13 (2024) 386 –397 394 newspapers issued by 41 Chinese cities demonstrates that local governments vary signi ﬁcantly in their response actions. Then, the fsQCA analysis shows three pathways to more diverse actions and two pathways to less diverse actions. Our analysis ﬁrstly echoes the existing studies emphasizing local capacity as an essential condition in in ﬂuencing local actions ( Goetz &Wang, 2020 ;Hu&Qian, 2017 ;Z .Liu&Ma, 2021 ;Ramsey-Musolf, 2017 ). All pathways to more diverse actions include the presence of local ﬁscal capacity, as well as one of the pathways to less diverse actions comprise the absence of it. However, the effect of ﬁscal capacity doesn't exist solely on its own, thus strong ﬁscal capacity doesn't necessarily lead to more diverse actions. Additionally, despite satisfying local housing demand being an initial objective of affordable housing policy, not all city govern- ments ’actions are driven only by social pressure of housing issues in practices ( Chiu-Shee &Zheng, 2019 ;Shen&Li, 2022 ). Even in the absence of severe housing affordability issues, cities may choose to develop affordable housing if it can be linked with overall urban development objectives, such as urban renewal, improving city identity, and attracting talent. Finally, while much discussion on the effect of housing mandates points to superior pressure incentivizing local actions ( Yu&Xu, 2022 ;Zhuo et al., 2022 ), our ﬁndings highlight"

In other words, if there is inadequate willingness or capacity, city governments still choose to respond to the hard targets to be assessed under upper-level pressure rather than take diverse actions. Our research offers policy implications for how to use the mandate as a strategy to facilitate affordable housing implementation at the local level. As city governments are the pivotal participants that address housing issues effectively, they need to be empowered adequately through technical and ﬁnancial assistance from the central and provincial governments, through appropriately designed schemes and programs. Also, policy makers should adjust the design of the mandate from simply focusing on the construction target to diverse dimensions. The limitations of this research are in order to increase the comparability between cases, only 41 cities which are high performers in the committed construction units of affordable housing are discussed. Although cities in three regions and most provinces of China have been deliberately selected in the research design to enhance the representation of cases, the lack of attention to speci ﬁc compliance actions of other cities still brings challenges to the external validity of the study.
