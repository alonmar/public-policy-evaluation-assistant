    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of setting up and utilizing a search and indexing system using Elasticsearch and Sentence Transformers. The workflow includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Libraries**: Essential libraries such as `sentence_transformers`, `elasticsearch`, `dotenv`, `transformers`, `json`, `os`, `tqdm`, `time`, and `torch` are imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading Environment Variables**: Environment variables are loaded using `load_dotenv()` to retrieve configurations like `ELASTIC_URL`, `MODEL_NAME`, `INDEX_NAME`, and `HUGGINGFACE_API`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loading the Model**: A pre-trained SentenceTransformer model is loaded using the specified `MODEL_NAME`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fetching Documents**: JSON documents are fetched from a specified directory, read, and aggregated into a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Setting up Elasticsearch**: An Elasticsearch index is set up with specific settings and mappings, including properties for document ID, page number, chunk ID, text, and text vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Indexing Documents**: The fetched documents are indexed into Elasticsearch. Each document's text is encoded into a dense vector using the SentenceTransformer model before indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **KNN Search in Elasticsearch**: A function is defined to perform a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) search in Elasticsearch using the encoded text vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Building Prompts**: A prompt is constructed for querying the language model, incorporating the search results from Elasticsearch.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Loading a Language Model**: A language model is loaded from Hugging Face using the specified model name and device configuration (CPU or GPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Generating Responses**: The language model generates responses to the constructed prompts, and the response time is measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Displaying Results**: The generated answers and response times are printed for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a search and indexing system, integrating machine learning models for text encoding and generation, and utilizing Elasticsearch for efficient document retrieval.\n"

This paper introduces the concepts of 'cityphilia' and 'cityphobia' as metaphors for the spatial attraction and repulsion forces that shape local quality of life. It aims to create and validate an operational framework for understanding citizens' appreci-ation and attachment to their living environment, often referred to as 'city love.' This framework considers two key components, 'body' and 'soul,' encompassing both physical and social aspects. Building upon Charles Tiebout's work on the competitive attractiveness of cities and aligning withcontemporary research on the geography of happiness, a conceptual model is developed and applied to identify and assess the components of city love using various indicators. These in- dicators encompass local attractiveness, local public expenditures, and inter-urban in-terdependencies. The model is empirically tested in the context of Flanders, Belgium, a regioncomprising 300 distinct municipalities, both urban and rural. A Beta regression model is employed, which incorporates spatial dependencies to examine multi-scalar effects on residential satisfaction. The results af ﬁrm the soundness of the 'city\"}"

While these studies discuss mostly the processes and impacts of gentrification, we are not aware of studies that focus on the methodologies of studying gentrification. In general, a methodological dichotomy characterizes much of the existing gentrification literature, as studies are either quantitative, “macro” analyses or qualitative, “micro” inqui-ries of neighborhoods in the form of case studies (Hammel and Wyly 1996). But there is often a “disconnect” between quantitative and qualitative approaches that are designed to gather and analyze different types of data, and only few gen-trification studies adopt a mixed-methods approach. The presence or absence of gentrification is often hotly debated by residents, who experience impacts such as increased rents or store closures in their neighborhoods, and policy makers and academics, who use aggregate census data to document neighborhood change and may not see these impacts. This article seeks to show the importance of incor - porating knowledge from both quantitative and qualitative methods to study gentrification. But although utilization of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies can paint a richer picture of gentrification, planners and policy makers',\n",

An example is the geographic distribution of infrastructure investment such as the building of a transit station. Neighborhood change may have positive or negative effects for residents. Following suburbanization, deindustri-alization, and white flight after World War II, many inner-city neighborhoods in the United States witnessed negative change—sharp disinvestment and decline. Early studies of neighborhood change focused on such decline or “descent,” as well as disinvestment, demographic shifts, and discrimi-natory practices (Massey and Denton 1993). More recently, following investments to regenerate inner cities, some stud-ies have focused on the consequences of the upward trajec-tories of neighborhoods, or neighborhood “ascent” (Zuk et al. 2015). Gentrification is a commonly studied outcome of neigh- borhood ascent (Zuk et al. 2015). The influx of higher-income new residents may lead to displacement of existing residents. Finding data that allow for the simultaneous measurement of physical, cultural, economic, and demo-graphic shifts ensuing from gentrification, however, can be an arduous task (Benton 2014). Thus, much research has only measured the magnitude of particular aspects or impacts of gentrification (often housing and demographic shifts) and has relied heavily on the US census (Schwirian 1983), described as the “most comprehensive and comparable source of data” on neighborhood change (Hammel and Wyly 1996, 248). Most quantitative studies of gentrification have taken a “macro,” census-based approach (Hammel and Wyly 1996). Their focus has been the measurement of',\n",

While these studies discuss mostly the processes and impacts of gentrification, we are not aware of studies that focus on the methodologies of studying gentrification. In general, a methodological dichotomy characterizes much of the existing gentrification literature, as studies are either quantitative, “macro” analyses or qualitative, “micro” inqui-ries of neighborhoods in the form of case studies (Hammel and Wyly 1996). But there is often a “disconnect” between quantitative and qualitative approaches that are designed to gather and analyze different types of data, and only few gen-trification studies adopt a mixed-methods approach. The presence or absence of gentrification is often hotly debated by residents, who experience impacts such as increased rents or store closures in their neighborhoods, and policy makers and academics, who use aggregate census data to document neighborhood change and may not see these impacts. This article seeks to show the importance of incor - porating knowledge from both quantitative and qualitative methods to study gentrification. But although utilization of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies can paint a richer picture of gentrification, planners and policy makers\\n\\ndoc_id: sideris_gonzales_ong\\nanswer: across neighbor - hoods in a metropolitan area because of spatial variations in these factors. An example is the geographic distribution of infrastructure investment such as the building of a transit station. Neighborhood change may have positive or negative effects for residents. Following suburbanization, deindustri-alization, and white flight after World War II, many inner-city neighborhoods in the United States witnessed negative change—sharp disinvestment and decline. Early studies of neighborhood change focused on such decline or “descent,” as well as disinvestment, demographic shifts, and discrimi-natory practices (Massey and Denton 1993). More recently, following investments to regenerate inner cities, some stud-ies have focused on the consequences of the upward trajec-tories of neighborhoods, or neighborhood “ascent” (Zuk et al. 2015). Gentrification is a commonly studied outcome of neigh- borhood ascent (Zuk et al. 2015). The influx of higher-income new residents may lead to displacement of existing residents. Finding data that allow for the simultaneous measurement of physical, cultural, economic, and demo-graphic shifts ensuing from gentrification, however, can be an arduous task (Benton 2014). Thus, much research has only measured the magnitude of particular aspects or impacts of gentrification (often housing and demographic shifts) and has relied heavily on the US census (Schwirian 1983), described as the “most comprehensive and comparable source of data” on neighborhood change (Hammel and Wyly 1996, 248). Most quantitative studies of gentrification have taken a “macro,” census-based approach (Hammel and Wyly 1996). Their focus has been the measurement of\\n\\ndoc_id: sideris_gonzales_ong\\nanswer: of Renewal: Housing Policy and the Resurgence of Gentrification.” Housing Policy Debate 10 (4): 711–71. Zuk, M., A.

      "\n",
      "Gentrification is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that affects urban neighborhoods in various ways. While some studies focus on the magnitude of gentrification, others emphasize the importance of incorporating qualitative methods to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issue. Here are the pros and cons of adopting a balanced approach to studying gentrification:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive understanding**: Incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods can provide a more nuanced understanding of gentrification, allowing researchers to capture the complex interactions between physical, cultural, economic, and demographic shifts.\n",
      "2. **Improved data collection**: Visual surveys and interviews can complement each other, providing a more detailed picture of neighborhood change brought about by gentrification.\n",
      "3. **Increased accuracy**: Mixed-methods approaches can reduce the risk of biased or incomplete data, leading to a more accurate understanding of gentrification.\n",
      "4. **Enhanced stakeholder engagement**: Incorporating stakeholder interviews can help researchers better understand the perspectives and experiences of residents, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in gentrification.\n",
      "5. **More representative samples**: Using a mixed-methods approach can increase the representativeness of the sample, allowing researchers to generalize findings to a broader population.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Increased complexity**: Adopting a mixed-methods approach can add complexity to the research design, making it more challenging to analyze and interpret the data.\n",
      "2. **Higher costs**: Conducting mixed-methods research can be more expensive than using a single methodology, particularly if the research involves multiple data collection methods.\n",
      "3. **Time-consuming**: Integrating multiple data collection methods can be time-consuming, requiring significant resources and effort.\n",
      "4. **Limited generalizability**: Mixed-methods research may not be as generalizable as single-method research, as the different data collection methods may not be equally representative of the population.\n",
      "5. **Potential for methodological limitations**: The use of multiple data collection methods can also introduce methodological limitations, such as the potential for biases or errors in data collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Balancing Act**\n",
      "\n",
      "To adopt a balanced approach to studying gentrification, researchers should:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clearly define research questions**: Establish specific research questions and objectives to guide the mixed-methods design.\n",
      "2. **Choose complementary data collection methods**: Select data collection methods that complement each other, such as visual surveys and interviews.\n",
      "3. **Use robust data analysis techniques**: Apply robust data analysis techniques\n"
